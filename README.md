## WeighIn

# Project Description: "WeighIn"

"WeighIn" is a crowdsourcing platform designed to tackle indecisiveness in group decision-making by allowing users to post questions or dilemmas and receive multiple-choice feedback from the crowd. Targeting college students and young adults, the platform functions like a social media tool where users can seek opinions on everyday decisions—ranging from where to eat, what to wear, or even broader life choices. Participants provide responses anonymously, and their answers are aggregated to reveal the most popular choice after three days.
